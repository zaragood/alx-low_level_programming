## Singly Linked List in C
This program implements a singly linked list data structure in the C programming language. The linked list contains nodes, each of which has an integer value and a pointer to the next node in the list.

## Files
This program consists of two files:

singly_linked_list.c: This file contains the implementation of the singly linked list data structure. It has functions to create a new linked list, add a node to the end of the list, remove a node from the list, and print the contents of the list.

main.c: This file contains the main function, which creates a new linked list, adds some nodes to the list, removes a node from the list, and prints the contents of the list.

## Usage
To use this program, you can compile the singly_linked_list.c and main.c files using a C compiler such as gcc:

gcc -o singly_linked_list singly_linked_list.c main.c
This will create an executable file called singly_linked_list. You can then run the program:

./singly_linked_list
The program will create a new linked list, add some nodes to the list, remove a node from the list, and print the contents of the list.
