LINKED LIST
A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element stores a reference (i.e., a pointer) to the next element in the sequence. Unlike an array, which stores elements in contiguous memory locations, a linked list can store its elements anywhere in memory, and the references between elements allow them to be accessed sequentially.

This implementation of a linked list is written in C++ and supports insertion, deletion, and traversal of nodes. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list.
