Linear Search: Simple and straightforward, it sequentially checks each element of the dataset until a match is found or the entire dataset has been traversed.
Binary Search: Requires a sorted dataset and operates by repeatedly dividing the search range in half until the target element is found.
Jump Search: Similar to binary search but divides the dataset into fixed blocks and performs a linear search within each block.
Interpolation Search: Suitable for uniformly distributed datasets, it estimates the position of the target element based on its value.
