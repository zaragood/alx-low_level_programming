# 0x18-dynamic_libraries

This directory contains source code files for creating a dynamic library containing various functions. The functions are implemented in C and can be compiled into a shared library (`libdynamic.so`). The dynamic library can be loaded and used by other programs at runtime.

## Compilation

To compile the source code into a dynamic library:

1. Navigate to this directory in your terminal.
2. Compile the source code files into object files.
3. Create the dynamic library using the compiled object files.

## Usage

After compiling the dynamic library, include the necessary header files and link against the library during program compilation to use the functions provided by the library.
